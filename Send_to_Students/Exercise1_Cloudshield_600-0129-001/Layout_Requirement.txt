
**Exercise1**
Below is Database from Customer, Please read through all. 
- Datasheets
- Doc: requirement and rules + DXF + Stackup
- Schematic: netlist + Schema + BOM (use for footprints checking)
- LIB: libary of some standard symbols
- Fabnote + Logo 

Requirements:
1. Import netlist + DXF/PDF into a board. According to customer's request on "tnsp_usbhub3_routing_rules", Board name is TNSP_USBHUB3. 

2. Build all missing footprints. If you need more information for footprints, please see "Creating and Checking Footprint Procedure" file in the Checklist_Document.

3. Add more layers as Stackup file "	 4 LAYERS_600-1129-01_stackup"

4. Add Artwork film by importing FILM_SETUP file

5. Phy constraint: 
Please set all rules as customer's requirement: Diff 90Ohm, power, 50 Ohm single ended traces....

6. Spacing constraint: 
GND to Mics. signals (50 Ohm) = 6 mils
GND to Sensetive analog signals (AVDD_2V5 AVSS_GND RREF XTAL1 XTAL2 XTAL2_R) = 15 mils
90 Ohm to GND = 20 mils
90Ohm to 90Ohm = 30 mils
90 Ohm to Power nets (except for GND)= 25 mils

7. Do placement:
Place some symbols based on DXF file
Use TextPad to place Symbols in each group together into Board
Place and Complete fanout for all symbols Within group(You should ratnet main symbol after that you will place other symbols easier).
Place all decoupling caps close to each corresponding pin
Led should be placed on TOP.

8. Do routing:
Make CHASSIS_GND shape along board outline with the spacing as below:
	Board outline to CHASSIS_GND  25-50 mils
	CHASSIS_GND to GND 25-50 mils
Add more CHASSIS_GND vias along with board outline with via to via spacing 200-400 mils
Complete all rat nets
Clean up DRCs
Implement lengh matching for all 90Ohm nets USB (5 mils tolorance)
Pour GND on Top and Bottom


9. Do silkscreen + Assembly both Top and Bottom. We will use Text block 2 (width height line_Space Photo_Width Char_Space --> 23 31 39 6 8) to do Silk + Assy or use text block that someone can see easily 

10. You can ignore requirement #10 if you don't want use Logo. 
Import fabnote with TEXT_BLOCK# 13 as below

TEXT_BLOCK# 13
  font:            ANSI
  height:          200.000
  width:           150.000
  photoplot width: 0.000
  spacing:         50.000
  line spacing:    250.000
 after that place Logo into Board.
11. Drill legend:
	a. Manufacture/NC/Drill customeization to check +/- tolerance of drill. According to normal standard we will have +/-3mils for plated and +/-2mils for non_plated, vias
	b. Run Drill legend at Manufacture/NC/Drill Legend to show Drill chart table on fab film 
  
12. Implement all section on PCB_Checklist and QC 

13. Check database and update DRCs

14. Generate Gerber files (ODB++ or manual), please see ODB++ Exporting_20Sep18 for guideline

15. Check short open with Cam350
	a. File/Import/ODB++ to import ODB file into Cam350
	b. Check all film to sure they are fine/OK
	c. Check Short and Open
		Tables/Layers to make sure that all layers are assigned correctly
		Go to Tools and run Netlist Extract to export the nets of ODB++ file, you can see the extracted nets on Design Data/Nets
		Go to Tools and run Compare External Nets to compare Nets with External nets. Cam350 will show you short or Open Nets. Recheck and correct them on Allegro.

The End.
