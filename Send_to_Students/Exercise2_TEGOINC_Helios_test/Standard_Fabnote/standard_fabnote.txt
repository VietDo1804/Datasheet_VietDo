********************* NOTE FOR VIAS IN PADS*****************
 
1) Here is the Fab note for via-in-pad.

"This design uses via in pad technology. The via holes (size = .xxx") shall be filled with
conductive epoxy then planalized and plated over.

 2) And the note below is for vias inside the BGA but "not" in pads.

"All vias inside the BGAs areas, which have a hole size of .xxx", shall be filled with
non-conductive epoxy then planarized and covered with solder mask. Plug height and/or dimples
shall not exceed the height of the plated pads".
